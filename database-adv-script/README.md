# Joins Queries

This project demonstrates how to use different types of SQL joins.

## 1. INNER JOIN
Retrieves all bookings along with the users who made them.

## 2. LEFT JOIN
Retrieves all properties and their reviews, including properties that have no reviews.

## 3. FULL OUTER JOIN
Retrieves all users and all bookings, even if the user has no booking or a booking is not linked to a user.
